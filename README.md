This project explores the foundational techniques of deep learning, including neural network construction and custom convolution operations. It begins with implementing a classification task using PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning, highlighting the development of custom architectures, hyperparameter tuning, and training scripts.<br><br>
In the second phase, I developed 1D and 2D convolution functions from scratch, applying them to signal and image data. The 1D convolution function was used to denoise a sine wave, demonstrating the impact of kernel size on smoothing noisy signals. The 2D convolution function was applied to grayscale and RGB images, showcasing the effects of blurring and Sobel operator-based edge detection.
